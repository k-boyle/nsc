#+TITLE: Function Inference

* Motivation
  Function inference allows for a function to have multiple overloads for the 
  same parameters types, but return values of different types depending on the context in which the 
  function was used.
  Function inference forms an integral part of NoSyn's extention framework, allowing the user of the language
  to create a DSL or general purpose language within NoSyn with great capability to customize it's syntax.

** Usage Example

#+BEGIN_SRC java
public static void main() {
  System.out.println("HELLO WORLD")
}
#+END_SRC
